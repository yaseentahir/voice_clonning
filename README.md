# Voice Cloning and Conversion Project

This project demonstrates how to perform voice cloning and conversion using various Python libraries and models. The goal is to synthesize speech using a cloned voice and then convert it to make the speech sound more natural and personalized. The process involves the following steps:

- Convert input audio files (in MP3 format) into WAV format.
- Use a TTS (Text-to-Speech) model to generate speech in the style of a given speaker.
- Perform voice conversion (e.g., pitch shifting) to further personalize the cloned voice.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- `soundfile`: For reading and writing audio files.
- `TTS`: For text-to-speech synthesis.
- `pydub`: For converting MP3 files to WAV.
- `librosa`: For audio processing and pitch shifting.
- `torch`: For machine learning and audio transformations.
- `torchaudio`: For handling audio data and transformations.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install soundfile TTS pydub librosa torch torchaudio
```

Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary model files and audio files for the voice cloning process.

## Project Structure

- `dataset/`: Contains the input audio files (MP3 files of the speaker's voice).
- `output_cloned/`: Directory where the generated and processed audio files will be saved.
- `xtts_model/`: The pre-trained TTS model (e.g., XTTS) for generating the cloned voice.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Prepare Input Audio Files**  
   Place your speaker's audio files in the `dataset/` folder. These should be MP3 files of the speaker reading different texts.

2. **Configure File Paths**  
   Ensure the paths in the script match the location of your audio files and the output directory. The default paths are as follows:

   - Input audio files:  
     `dataset/yaseen1.mp3`, `dataset/yaseen2.mp3`, `dataset/yaseen3.mp3`
   
   - Output directory:  
     `output_cloned/`

3. **Run the Script**  
   Execute the script to generate a cloned voice and perform voice conversion:

   ```bash
   python voice_cloning_script.py
   ```

   The script will:
   - Convert MP3 files to WAV if necessary.
   - Generate cloned speech using the TTS model and input audio files.
   - Perform voice conversion on the generated audio to improve its naturalness.

4. **Results**  
   The following files will be saved in the `output_cloned/` directory:
   - `cloned_voice_combined.wav`: The initial cloned voice output.
   - `cloned_voice_converted.wav`: The final voice-converted audio file.

## Voice Conversion Details

The voice conversion is performed by simulating pitch shifting to match the target speaker's voice characteristics. Currently, a placeholder method (pitch shifting) is used. You can replace this with a more sophisticated voice conversion model if available.

## Notes

- Ensure the input audio files are of good quality for better cloning results.
- The TTS model used in this project is `xtts_v2`. You may need to download or point to the correct pre-trained model if not already available.
